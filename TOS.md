## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Demonic Addictions Verification** (“the Bot”), a Discord verification and moderation system developed by **DiscipleShadow**.  

By inviting or using the Bot, you (“the User”) agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”) and to comply with all applicable laws and Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

---

## 2. Eligibility and Use

- By using the Bot, you affirm that you meet the age requirement and are authorized to manage or participate in the server where the Bot is installed.  
- The Bot is intended **only for lawful use** and in compliance with Discord’s API Terms.

## 3. Core Functionality
The Bot provides:
- Automated **age and verification systems** for Discord servers  
- **Moderation utilities**, such as verified/unverified lists  
- **Server analytics** and age mapping tools  
- **Developer notifications** for policy and feature updates  
- **Premium features** via Discord subscriptions (for whitelisting, advanced analytics, and other extended tools)

Server administrators are responsible for configuring verification roles and ensuring local compliance with applicable community and privacy rules.

## 4. Premium Features and Subscriptions
### 4.1 Payment and Renewal
- Premium access is managed through **Discord’s built-in monetization system**.  
- All transactions and renewals occur **solely through Discord**.

## 5. Whitelist and Verification Systems
- Servers may use a **whitelist system** to exempt specific users from age or verification checks.  
- Whitelists are **server-specific** and maintained locally by that server’s configuration.  
- Abuse of whitelisting (e.g., to bypass Discord’s ToS or community safety rules) may result in suspension or blacklist actions by the Bot.

The Bot collects limited information necessary for its features, including:
- Discord IDs (user, server)  
- Verification states and trust data
