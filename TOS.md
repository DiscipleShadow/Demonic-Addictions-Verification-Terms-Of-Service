## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Demonic Addictions Verification** (“the Bot”). By using this Bot, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). These Terms govern your use of the Bot across any Discord server (“Server”) in which it is installed.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Bot.

---

## 2. Purpose
The Bot is designed to provide secure and automated age verification, birthday announcements, and server management functions within Discord. It serves as a privacy-friendly verification alternative that does not require users to submit government-issued identification.

## 3. Features
- **Age Verification System:** Assigns roles based on user-submitted age data.  
- **Birthday Announcements:** Optional automated birthday messages in designated channels.  
- **Premium Features:** Available through Discord’s built-in monetization system and renewed monthly. Premium unlocks advanced tools such as:  
  - Server-specific whitelist functionality (bypass verification restrictions).  
  - Expanded role limits and analytics features.  
- **Verification Management:**  
  - Moderators can view verified and unverified users.  
  - Reports for users unreachable during verification attempts.  
  - Automated reminders for users who have not completed verification.  
- **Data Transparency:**  
  - Users may request to view all data currently stored about them.  
  - Users may see which servers they are verified in.  
- **Server Analytics:** Generates summary data (e.g., user verification counts, age maps, and grouping statistics) from encrypted data.  
- **Encrypted Storage:** All collected data is encrypted (SQLite + monthly rotating keys).  
- **Advanced User Management:** Blacklist, watchlist, trust scoring, and notification systems.  
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All verification activities are logged for moderation and audit purposes.  
- **Developer Communication:** Bot developers may send system or policy update notifications to server owners through built-in commands.

- When opting out:

  - The user will no longer be eligible to use most verification-related features.  
- Servers may remove stored analytics or configuration data by resetting or removing the Bot.
